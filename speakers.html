                                        Derek Ruths is an assistant professor of Computer Science at McGill University.  He joined the faculty in 2009 after completing his PhD in Computer Science at Rice University.  A major research direction in his group considers the problem of characterizing and predicting the large-scale dynamics of human behavior in online social platforms.  His ongoing work in this area includes quantitatively modeling how communities change over time, measuring and predicting group demographics from unstructured user-generated content, and computational methods for assessing discussion topics within a collection of users.  His work has been published in top-tier journals and conferences including Science, ICWSM, and PLoS Computational Biology.  His research is currently funded by a wide array of organizations including NSERC, SSHRC, tech companies, and the US National Science Foundation - underscoring the broad, interdisciplinary nature of his work.                                    </p>

                                        Maria has attended almost every CUSEC since 2007 as an exhibitor, promoting IBM’s unique, top-talent internship program Extreme Blue. During her time as the Extreme Blue Canada Program Manager, she had the honour and privilege of working with both technical and business student prodigies, most of whom now work at amazing technology companies like Google, IBM, Facebook, Amazon & Shopify (to name just a few). Maria thinks herself extremely fortunate to be able to call most of her former interns great friends.</p><p>Nowadays, Maria is the Manager of Branding and Partnerships at TechU.me – an innovative program run by the Ottawa Network for Education that encourages high school students to explore STEM education and careers. The program’s flagship initiative is its Mentor Program, in which teams of high school and elementary school students work together to develop curriculum-based mobile apps with the help of industry mentors. A big part of Maria’s job is “working her network” (of afore-mentioned great friends) to find awesome mentors to participate in the program.</p><p>Although not a techie by training (she holds a BComm and has just completed her MBA…gasp!), Maria is a geek at heart, having once co-founded a secret DDR society. Her most intimate experience with software engineering was an undergrad elective – Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming – in which she received an A-…in large part thanks to her Extreme Blue interns at the time.                                    </p>
