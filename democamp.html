                                Flow is a website designed to help students at the University of Waterloo plan their university courses. The website offers descriptions, schedules, ratings, and reviews for courses offered at the university. It also allows students to see what courses their friends are taking, what they've taken, and their thoughts on those courses. To date, 4400 students have signed up for the product, along with others who use the website without an account.                            </p>

                                We met each other through being classmates over the past 4 years. Over a year ago, we decided to work on a project together and brainstormed hundreds of ideas about what to build. We ended up continuing and expanding on a side project that one of the team members, Mack Duan, had already been working on. His project tackled the problem of trying to make informed course decisions when we had to select courses each term. <a href="http://uwflow.com/">http://uwflow.com/</a>                            </p>

                                This is an experiment designed for the IOS/Android platform. It features augmented 3D models which extend the physical installation titled Homunculus Agora by Dr. Mark-David Hosale. This application along side the physical installation was displayed in the Markham Museum for the LandSlide Art Exhibition. This application is a virtual representation launched when the user scans a designated target with their device. <br/>Through the app, visitors of the gallery are immersed within an augmented reality experience that provides an alternate view and virtual flythrough of the piece. In addition, series of markers located in the exhibition connect to virtual information panels that describe various aspects and details of the work. <br/>This application was showcased alongside Dr. Hosale's piece in the following countries: <br/>1) Canada (LandSlide Future Possibilities Exhibit - Ontario)<br/>2) China (Shenzhen Bi-City Biennale of Urbanism/Architecture - Hong Kong)<br/>3) Denmark (renew Digital Arts Forum - Copenhagen)<br/>It is currently available on the Google Play Store, and is in the process of being accepted to the Apple AppStore.                            </p>

                                We were recruited by the artist who required developers to design a mobile application that would accompany his piece in the Markham Museum. Dr. Mark-David Hosale was also interested in taking his piece to several different exhibitions internationally, and wanted a standalone application which would provide users with information on the piece as well as extend the virtual experience. <br/>We met with the artist and brainstormed ideas for an augmented reality concept which was later on developed and exhibited in the museum. Due to the large physical size of the piece, transporting it internationally was not feasible, therefore this application would be useful for those who wanted to see the piece in it's entirety. Inspiration was drawn from the idea of virtual spaces, and the idea of experiencing physical objects without being physically present in the space. <br/>Here is a link to the Google Play store where Homunculus Series AR can be downloaded: <a href="http://bit.ly/1d1rzvq">http://bit.ly/1d1rzvq</a> <br/>**It is currently in the process of being accepted to the Apple AppStore.                            </p>

                                See where in the world the fBomb was dropped. This is an interactive map that shows where people are using the F-word on Twitter. The app is written in CoffeeScript and uses the express framework for Node.js. It hooks into Twitter's streaming api, particularly the POST statuses/filter and uses bootstrap, JQuery, and Google Maps on the front end. Since being published in late October last year, the app has received international press coverage, 3K+ shares on Twitter, 9K+ shares on Facebook, and over 250K unique visitors from around the world. <br/>There is a full write up at <a href="http://mgingras.ca/coding/fBomb/">.http://mgingras.ca/coding/fBomb/</a>                            </p>

                                My inspiration for this application actually came from a discussion I had with two colleagues of mine while doing co-op at BlackBerry, Ryan Seys and Elliott Ro. We were talking about how people misuse and abuse the english language. As the conversation devolved swearing was brought up. In particular we talked about how swearing can completely undermine ones argument. Earlier that day we had been talking about the personal projects we were working and, somehow at this point we circled back to that topic. From there our conversation wound it's way to how it'd be neat to map where people swear. Within a few minutes and iterations of ideas the concept for the app was born. <br/>Project: <a href="http://www.fbomb.co">http://www.fbomb.co</a> - Code: <a href="http://www.github.com/mgingras/fBomb">http://github.com/mgingras/fBomb</a>                            </p>

                                I'm doing research on Intelligent Machines. I'm looking at the math behind how they would operate and the abstract models on which they could be based. I'm also exploring the how to design such a model of intelligence and considerations around various aspects of the design and implementation of intelligent machines. I’ve been incorporating many diverse ideas into my work, from my own investigative research, to the mathematical and philosophical works of Aristotle and George Boole, and to the modern ideas in artificial intelligence from the last 60 years. <br/> I’m working on this project independently. I'm writing a series of papers on this topic. The first paper in the series is close to completion, and will be a 30-page broad introduction to the fundamental theory behind this work and to serve as an intuitive basis from which to understand later works in the series.                            </p>

                                I was inspired by some lectures that we're given by Stanford professor Andrew Ng, where he discussed deep learning algorithms and the brain. Since over one year ago, I haven't been able to stop thinking about this problem of how to build an intelligent machine. Ray Kurzweil, Director of Engineering at Google, believes that we’re very close to building this type of technology, and that's the goal I'm working towards.                            </p>

                                MacPoint is a proposed solution towards the current problem of the McMaster University's community unable to navigate throughout the campus due to the lack of an user-friendly and interactive navigation system. MacPoint is a mobile application where one can easily identify the various buildings spread throughout the campus and their respective hours of operation in a visually elegant presentation. <br/>Currently, MacPoint is implemented to work with Android devices as it is in the state of beta testing and it will be implemented to also accommodate iOS, BlackBerry and Windows devices.                            </p>

                                In December 2011, Thusanthan stayed late on McMaster University campus and was looking to purchase refreshments from a Tim Hortons. <br/>Unfortunately, he did not realize that every establishment was closed for the night. Frustrated, Thusanthan had an epiphany, realizing he could have saved so much time and energy if he had only known the opening and closing times beforehand. After consulting his close friends, Kulwinder Billen and Jerry Oku who became close friends through university, the trio decided to remedy this problem through the creation of a new Android application, MacPoint.                            </p>
